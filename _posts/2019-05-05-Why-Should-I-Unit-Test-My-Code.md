# Why should I unit test my code?

Hi everyone, today we are going to explore the **WHY question** on unit testing the code.

A very popular debate which I have observed in the developers’ world is *whether or not to write unit test cases for code and how writing those test cases could(no, it shouldn’t) be an overhead for the developers.*

In my experience of more than 5 years of coding(mostly web development), I have met very few people who willingly unit test almost everything they code. So I feel that it’s the need of the hour to talk more about it and focus more on [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (Test Driven Development).

**As quoted by one of the articles [here](https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/a-short-lecture-on-the-value-and-practice-of-unit/), unit tests are so important that they should be a first class language construct.**

**Me: Yes please.. it’s about time now!!**
